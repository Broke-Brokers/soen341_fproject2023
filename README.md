## Important notes and Updates

***
### 2023-09-29

We learned that our repository was not correctly set up on 2023-09-28
* We have created an organization : https://github.com/Broke-Brokers
* And a team : https://github.com/orgs/Broke-Brokers/teams/broke-brokers
* And cloned our old repository here.

It also came to our attention from the prof's updates on the sprint #2 planning that we did not intorduce the backlog and sprints backlog in the correct manner. We did not know we could use the "project"  and "issue" tab to do this. 

We will transfer all the information from external files and internal .md files and wiki to the project tab and create issues from the tasks. 

_For sprint #1 the files can be found here_:

* [Project backlog](https://github.com/Broke-Brokers/soen341_fproject2023/wiki/Project-Backlog#broke-brokers-project-backlog)
* [sprint #1 backlog](https://github.com/Broke-Brokers/soen341_fproject2023/wiki/Project-Backlog#sprint-1)
* [sprint #1 task breakdown](https://github.com/Broke-Brokers/soen341_fproject2023/blob/main/Sprint%20%231/Sprint1_TaskBreakdown.md)
* [sprint #2 backlog](https://github.com/Broke-Brokers/soen341_fproject2023/blob/main/Sprint%20%232/Sprint2_Backlog.md)

## 1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
This project uses Agile Scrum principles and consists of creating a real estate web application 
to serve homebuyers, property renters, brokers, and administrators. 
The project duration is 12 weeks and comprises 4 incremental sprints. 
The web application allows users to search for properties, save favourites,
